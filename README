functions to implement Gaussian Process regression in R and C

Brief:

A project to implement scalar gaussian process regression with a variety of covariance functions with an optional (up to 3rd order) linear regression prior mean. Maximum likelihood hyperparameters can be estimated to parameterize a given set of training data. For a given model (estimated hyperparams and training data set) the posterior mean and variance can be sampled at arbitrary locations in the parameter space. 

The model parameter space can take any dimension (within limits of the optimizer), output must be scalar. 

Primary user interface is through R, rbind.c & EmuRbind.R. The heavy lifting takes place in libEmu.

Depends:

cmake 
gsl
R

Installs: 
bins, estimatior and emulator to ~/local/bin. 
libs, libRbind, libEmu, libLBFGS to ~/local/lib
R<->C bindings, ~/local/include/libRbind: EmuRbind.R, rbind.h

Compiling:

mkdir build
cd build; 
cmake ..
make install;
