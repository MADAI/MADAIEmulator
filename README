One line: A method to interpolate results from expensive simulations. 

Brief:
This is a project to implement a gaussian process based emulator. An emulator being a statistical model for some process. This code supposes that you wish to emulate the output of some complicated computer code, which takes any number of inputs and produces a single scalar output for each vector of inputs. 

The points in the input-space and the output of the model are used to train a gaussian process to produce points which will interpolate the initial training points. 

With some fiddling it should be possible to extrapolate some small distance from the training points.

Things to know:
			
Emulator: Supports many inputs, single output models
multifit: Will only multi-region on 1d input models
